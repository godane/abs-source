Subject: Re: sdl 64bit problem [PATCH]

Le sam, 03/07/2004 � 18:20 +0200, Hans-Frieder Vogt a �crit :
> Hi list,

> I found the problem that lead to the distorted sound in tuxracer on AMD64. It
> may have also been the cause for the other reported sound problems with SDL.
> The problem is not in SDL, but in SDL-mixer.
> There, music files (*.it, and probably others as well) are incorrectly read on
> all 64 bit architectures but Alpha, due to an incorrect data type definition.
> The attached patch should solve the problem for all 64 bit architectures on
> Linux, since at least cpp defines _LP64 and __LP64__ for them.
> _LP64 indicates that long ints and pointers are 64 bits, but integers are 32
> bits.
> I am not sure whether the usage of _LP64 is also standard for the commercial
> compilers, and for other Unixes, but at least Solaris 9 defines _LP64 in the
> 64 bit environment as well.
